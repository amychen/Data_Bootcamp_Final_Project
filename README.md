With the increasing number of people moving into New York City, we wanted to analyze whether landlords are starting to break housing and preservation laws more often than before since most housing are becoming older and more expensive to maintain. With the dataset from NYC Housing Preservation and Development, we had access to housing data for the five boroughs in NYC, so we were able to narrow down which boroughs resulted in the largest number of violations. With that, we also wanted to see whether there is a correlation between complaints and violations (e.g. how often complaints turned into violations upon inspection). Ultimately, we wanted to have a better understanding of how HPD goes about maintaining housing in NYC and whether NYCâ€™s population density in recent years has resulted in an influx of violations.
